# Goal
This repository was created to provide an example of markdown file generated with Firefox's addon [Markdown Viewer Webext](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer-webext/) (link to its [github](https://github.com/KeithLRobertson/markdown-viewer)), with a code snippet featuring some plantuml.

# Remarks
* My workflow consists in:
	1. Creating a local `.md` file
	1. Opening that local file with Firefox
	1. The Markdown Viewer Webext would render the html, but the `.md` would still be in the url bar
* Until now, I'm using plantuml's **beta** version locally and from the command line to generate my plantuml images
	* but I like to have both the possibilities for:
		1. standalone images
		1. markdown-embedded plantuml
